This file briefly explains the organization of Flower server.

app.py: tells server to do the following: setup - train - shutdown.
server.py: BSP server implementation.
server_ssp.py: SSP server implementation.

Implementation design:
app.py is not aware of the FL algorithm.
Instead, Server and ServerSSP implements the core of the FL algorithms (in their `fit` method).
