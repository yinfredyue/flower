This file briefly explains the organization of Flower client.

client.py: abstract class Client.
numpy_client.py: NumPyClientWrapper and NumPyClientSSPWrapper, wrapper around NumPyClient and NumPyClientSSP.
app.py: tells each Client to do the loop: receive a message; handle message; generate and send a reply message.

message_handler.py dispatches the message to Client (wrappers) methods, which invokes methods of NumPyClient and
NumPyClientSSP.

Implementation design:
The basic operations are implemented at NumPyClient. For example, examples/quickstart_pytorch/client.py CifarClient
implements methods like `fit`, and `evaluate`. However, the NumPyClient is not aware of the FL algorithm - this
client implementation can be used to BSP, SSP, ASP, or anything else.
Instead, the Client (NumPyClientWrapper, NumPyClientSSPWrapper) define the client's behavior under different algorithms.
